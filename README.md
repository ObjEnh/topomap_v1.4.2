The software package 'topomap_v1.4.2' enhances the classification results of remote sensing imagery 
by generalizing the content and vectorizing the irregular outlines of imaged objects. Vector data of 
urban environments are generated in an automated way and with high geometric and cartographic quality. 
The user may monitor the intermediate results which are displayed graphically together with the source data. 
The derived coordinates of the corner points may be stored together with a label in topographic databases 
and used in Geographic Information Systems. The package has the potential to contribute to national and private mapping 
projects and to crowd sourcing. It is a new version and replaces the previous version (buildenh_v1.4).The package
has been renamed because other topographic objects than buildings may also be processed. 

A detailed description of the package 'topomap_v1.4.2' and an installation guide are located in the directory '/docs'. 
All R scripts are in the /R directory. Supporting scripts may be found in the 'support' directory and solutions (tables) 
for special objects (buildings) of examples may be seen in the directory 'data'. The package is started by the script
'startup_topomap_v1.4.2.R'.
